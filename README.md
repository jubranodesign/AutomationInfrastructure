# 🚀 C# Playwright Automation Infrastructure

This project presents an advanced End-to-End (E2E) testing infrastructure, based on Playwright and C# (.NET). The solution demonstrates rigorous application of clean architecture principles, high test stability, and effective separation between the UI and API layers.

## 🛠️ Key Technologies

* **Automation Tool:** Microsoft Playwright
* **Language:** C\# / .NET
* **Testing Framework:** **xUnit**

## 🎯 Architectural Design & Key Decisions

The project's design focuses on **maintainability, reusability, and stability**, crucial for production-grade automation:

### 1. Separation of Concerns (API & POM)
* **Generic API Client:** The `MediaWikiApiClient` is highly generic. It accepts the `pageTitle` in the constructor and the `sectionTitle` dynamically in the method (`GetSectionContentByTitleAsync`), maximizing the client's **reusability** across different wiki pages.
* **Specific Page Object Model ($\text{POM}$):** The $\text{POM}$ classes (e.g., `WikipediaPlaywrightPage`) are **specific to a single page's content**. This prevents the $\text{POM}$ from becoming bloated and ensures high clarity regarding its responsibilities.
* **Navigation Isolation:** Expensive navigation operations (`page.GotoAsync`) are explicitly **kept out of the $\text{POM}$** classes, residing only in the test or flow layer to better manage $\text{I/O}$ costs and test flow.

### 2. Robustness and Locator Strategy
* **Playwright Native Locators:** Avoided the use of JavaScript injection (`EvaluateAsync`) in favor of native $\text{Playwright Locators}$ and **XPath** (where needed for complex traversal). This ensures test stability by leveraging $\text{Playwright}$'s built-in **Auto-Waiting** mechanisms.

### 3. xUnit Fixtures and Resource Management
* **Setup/Cleanup:** Resource initialization and cleanup (e.g., `IPage`, `IAPIRequestContext`) are implemented using **xUnit Class or Collection Fixtures** and the **IDisposable interface**. This ensures proper state isolation and execution time optimization.

## 📁 Repository Structure

The project structure is organized for clear separation of responsibilities:

ApiClients/ 
API Layer: Generic API clients (e.g., MediaWikiApiClient) and JSON parsing.
Pages/
UI Layer: Specific Page Object Models (Locators and UI interaction methods).
Tests/ 
Test Layer: Contains all xUnit test execution logic and setup.
Fixtures/ 
xUnit Setup: Fixture classes (IClassFixture/ICollectionFixture) for resource lifecycle
TestClasses/ 
Actual xUnit Test Classes (which consume the Fixtures).

## 🏃 Getting Started

1.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure the $\text{.NET SDK}$ is installed.
2.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone
    ```
3.  **Install Playwright Browsers (One-time):**
    ```bash
    dotnet tool install --global Microsoft.Playwright.CLI
    playwright install
    ```
4.  **Run Tests:** Execute all tests using the $\text{.NET CLI}$:
    ```bash
    dotnet test
    ```
